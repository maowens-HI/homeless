## Source 1: Ludwig & Rauh - Hoover Institution Essay
**"Homelessness in California: Practical Solutions for a Complex Problem"**

### Key Facts & Figures
| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Unsheltered homeless in CA (2020) | 113,000+ (>50% of US total) |
| CA homelessness growth 2010-2020 | 31% overall, 57% unsheltered |
| National trend same period | Decreased ~9% |
| State spending (2022-23 budget) | $9.4 billion allocated |
| PSH unit growth since 2010 | 150% increase |
| Chronic homeless with mental/substance issues | ~75% (LA Times data) |

### Core Arguments
1. **Transparency Crisis**: No entity effectively oversees state homelessness response; Cal ICH lacks statutory authority
2. **Housing First Critique**: PSH grew 150% since 2010, yet homelessness grew too; after 5 years, only 36% retain housing
3. **Contingency Management Works**: 86% of CM studies show significant treatment effects; VA program had 92% negative drug tests
4. **Law Enforcement Role**: Prop 47 reduced leverage for court-ordered treatment; drug courts reduce recidivism
5. **Key Stat**: 83% of CA counties have ZERO chemical dependency beds; 43% have no inpatient psychiatric care

### Recommendations (from source)
- Repeal Housing First mandates (SB 1380)
- Expand contingency management programs
- Enforce existing laws + expand diversion courts
- Remove housing development barriers

## Source 2: Lee Ohanian - Hoover Institution Article
**"California Homelessness Rises to 187,000, Perhaps Many More, Despite $37 Billion Spent"** (March 2025)

### Key Facts & Figures
| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Homeless count (current) | ~187,000 |
| Spending since 2019 | $37 billion |
| Per-homeless-person equivalent | ~$245,000 per person (151K in 2019) |
| Growth since 2015 | 60% increase |
| Growth since 2019 | 24% increase |
| Actual served (2023 LAO report) | 337,000 individuals |

### Three Damning Audits Referenced
1. **State Auditor (2024)**: Cal ICH hasn't consistently tracked/evaluated efforts; no consistent method for gathering cost/outcome data
2. **Federal Audit (Aug 2024)**: Dept of Housing gave LOWEST possible score for fraud detection; $319.5M federal funds at risk
3. **LAO Report (recent)**: No data on encampment-to-permanent-housing transitions; Legislature lacks basic program outputs

### Key Quote for Op-Ed
> "Housing First means that California doesn't require those receiving housing to be sober, nor to receive any type of treatment... This approach implicitly incentivizes the continued use of drugs and alcohol"

## Source 3: CalMatters - "How CARE Court Lost Its Teeth"
**December 2025**

### The Promise vs. Reality

```
NEWSOM'S ORIGINAL VISION          WHAT BECAME LAW
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────
• Counties fined for              • No fines issued
  non-compliance
• Court-ordered treatment         • Almost all voluntary
  mandates                          (514 of 528 enrollees)
• 7,000-12,000 eligible           • Only 528 enrolled
• Real accountability             • "Soft power" only
```

### How the Bill Was Diluted
1. **Eligibility Narrowed**: Originally mental illness + substance use; narrowed to schizophrenia/psychotic disorders only
2. **Petitioner Burdens Increased**: More documentation required, "vexatious litigant" warnings added
3. **County Requirements Loosened**: "Shall include" became "may include"; housing not required
4. **Medication Orders Limited**: Forcibly administered medication banned; no penalties for refusal

### Key Quote
> "I've wondered (about) the point of a court with no real power" - Anita Fisher, San Diego mother who called program a "total failure"

---

## Source 4: CalMatters - "New California Law Expands CARE Court"
**December 2025**

### Key Updates
- SB 27 expands eligibility to include bipolar I disorder with psychotic features
- Combines two early hearings into one
- Criminal justice can now refer directly to CARE Court
- **Current numbers**: 3,092 petitions received; 684 agreements; only 22 court-ordered plans

## Data Synthesis for Op-Ed

### The Spending Paradox
```
MONEY IN                           RESULTS OUT
───────────                        ───────────
$37 billion spent                  187,000+ homeless
$9.4B annual budget                60% increase since 2015
~$245,000 per person               No outcome tracking
150% more PSH units                Homelessness still rose
```

### The Real Problem (by the numbers)
- **75%** of chronically homeless have mental illness/substance abuse
- **83%** of CA counties have ZERO chemical dependency beds
- **43%** of counties have NO inpatient psychiatric care
- **Drug overdose** = #1 cause of death among homeless in LA & SF

### What's NOT Working
- Housing First (no sobriety/treatment requirements)
- HHAP grants (being cancelled)
- CARE Court (diluted to voluntary program)
- Current spending (no accountability)

### What WOULD Work (Josh's argument)
- Mandatory treatment pathways via CARE Court reform
- Contingency management (86% effective in studies)
- Drug courts (3x less likely to be re-arrested)
- Law enforcement + diversion courts
- Actual outcome tracking
