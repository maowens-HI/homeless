## I. BIG PICTURE OVERVIEW

### A. Big Spending

**Total Spending: $37 billion since 2019**
- Source: [Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov) / [Hoover Institution - Ohanian](https://www.hoover.org/research/california-homelessness-rises-187000-perhaps-many-more-despite-37-billion-spent)
- Location in Ohanian article: Third paragraph under "Homelessness in California" section

**Per-Person Spending Calculation:**
- $37 billion / 187,000 homeless = ~$197,000 per homeless person
- Ohanian calculates: "$37 billion spent on homelessness by California is equivalent to about $245,000 per each of the 151,000 homeless people counted in 2019"
- Source: Ohanian, page 3, final paragraph

**Current Homeless Population:**
- **187,000** homeless Californians (largest unsheltered population in nation)
- **48 per 10,000** experience homelessness in California vs. **23 per 10,000** national average
- Source: [HUD 2024 Annual Homeless Assessment Report](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/)
- Location: Page 8, Exhibit 1-9: Estimates of People Experiencing Homelessness by State, 2024

**Context on Scale:**
> "If these 187,000 individuals were their own city, that city would be ranked around the 137th largest in the country, roughly the same size as Akron, Ohio, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida."
- Source: Ohanian article, paragraph 2

---

### B. Failed Audits

**Three independent audits reached the same conclusion: California does not know if its homelessness spending works.**

#### 1. State Auditor (2024)
> "The State lacks current information on the ongoing costs and outcomes of its homelessness programs, because Cal ICH [California Interagency Council on Homelessness] **has not consistently tracked and evaluated the State's efforts** to prevent and end homelessness. . . . Cal ICH has also not aligned its action plan to end homelessness with its statutory goals to collect financial information and ensure accountability and results. . . . Another significant gap in the State's ability to assess programs' effectiveness is that it does not have a consistent method for gathering information on the costs and outcomes for individual programs."
- Source: [California State Auditor Report](https://www.auditor.ca.gov), 2024
- Location: Quoted in Ohanian article, page 1-2

#### 2. Federal Audit (August 2024)
- California's Department of Housing and Community Development received **the lowest possible score** due to inadequate fraud detection
- **$319.5 million** in federal funding at risk
- Source: [HUD Office of Inspector General](https://www.hudoig.gov)
- Location: Ohanian article, page 2, paragraph 1

#### 3. Legislative Analyst's Office (Recent)
> "Despite the various reporting requirements . . . **no data have been provided to the Legislature** on how many people living in an encampment have received permanent housing (or any other type of housing). The Legislature lacks other key outcomes data such as the number of encampments that have been resolved. In addition, although some partial information on outputs was shared with the Legislature in prior years, updated and more complete data have not been provided. As a result, **the Legislature does not have basic information on program outputs** such as how many people in encampments have been provided with case management services (such as housing search assistance) and the number of housing units brought on line with grant funds."
- Source: [Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov)
- Location: Quoted in Ohanian article, page 2

### C. Not About Housing (Housing First Failure)

**Key Statistic: 37% increase in homelessness since Housing First mandate**

> "Housing First has been the mandated approach in the state since 2016, and since that time, **homelessness has increased by 37 percent** despite massive growth in permanent supportive housing units."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, Hoover Institution
- Location: Page 16, Conclusion, paragraph 3

**PSH Units vs. Homelessness:**
- Permanent supportive housing (PSH) units increased **150%** from 2010-2020
- Yet homelessness still grew during same period
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 6, Figure 3
- Data: [HUD Exchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/)

**Long-Term Housing Retention Problems:**
> "Participants retained housing after five years just **36 percent of the time**, and many moved multiple times to avoid eviction, with each move increasing the risk of returning to homelessness."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 7, citing Roncarati study

**San Francisco PSH Study:**
> "A study on single-room occupancy hotels from the *San Francisco Chronicle* found that **a quarter of the 515 PSH participants** tracked by the city exited the program by dying and **more than a fifth returned to homelessness**."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 7
- Original source: San Francisco Chronicle, April 26, 2022

**[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER: Housing inventory vs. homeless population, 2010-2020]**
- Data sources:
  - Homeless counts: [CoC Homeless Populations and Subpopulations Reports - HUD Exchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-homeless-populations-and-subpopulations-reports/)
  - Housing Inventory: [CoC Housing Inventory Count Reports - HUD Exchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-housing-inventory-count-reports/)
- *Note: Let me know if you would like me to update this figure with more recent data for the final draft*

### D. Mental Health and Drugs

**The Core Problem:**

> "About **75% of chronically homeless individuals** are dealing with substance abuse, severe mental illness, or both, which means that even if many of them are provided housing, they may remain unable to contribute to society."
- Source: Ohanian article, page 3, third paragraph from bottom

**LA County Data (2019 Point-in-Time Survey):**
> "The *Los Angeles Times* examined 2019 point-in-time count surveys in the county to find that **76 percent of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness** reported being, or were observed to be, **affected by mental illness, substance abuse, or physical illnesses**."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 7
- Original: [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-07/homeless-population-mental-illness-disability), October 7, 2019

**Leading Cause of Death:**
> "Reports from the Departments of Public Health of both Los Angeles and San Francisco counties show that the **primary cause of death among people experiencing homelessness is drug overdose or acute drug toxicity**."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 7
- Original sources:
  - [LA County Department of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3825), April 2022
  - [SF Department of Public Health](https://sf.gov/news/homeless-deaths-doubled-sf-during-first-year-pandemic-mostly-drug-overdoses), March 2022

**Treatment Facility Gap:**
> "**83 percent of counties in California have zero chemical dependency beds** and **43 percent have no inpatient psychiatric care** services at all."
- Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 14
- Original: [California Hospital Association, California Psychiatric Bed Annual Report](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CHA-Psych-Bed-Data-Report-Sept.-2018.pdf), August 2018

**The Housing First Problem:**
> "Housing First means that California doesn't require those receiving housing to be sober, nor to receive any type of treatment for mental health or substance abuse issues. **This approach implicitly incentivizes the continued use of drugs and alcohol** and avoidance of mental health treatment."
- Source: Ohanian article, page 3

**Note on the 75% statistic:**
- Lee Ohanian cites this in his article, referencing Ludwig & Rauh
- Ludwig & Rauh cite LA Times data from 2019 PIT survey (Table A.1)
- The 75% figure may derive from older studies (Kuhn and Culhane, 1998), though recent LA County data shows 76%
- Source verification: Ludwig & Rauh, Table A.1 and footnote 21

## II. WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING?

### A. Camping/Encampment Policy

**Supreme Court Ruling (June 2024):**
- **City of Grants Pass v. Johnson**: U.S. Supreme Court ruled **6-3** that public camping bans (and penalties for violating them) don't automatically violate the Eighth Amendment
- Source: [Reuters - "US Supreme Court backs anti-camping laws used against homeless people"](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-backs-anti-camping-laws-used-against-homeless-people-2024-06-28/)

**Governor's Executive Order:**
- **Executive Order N-1-24** (July 2024): Directs state agencies to clear encampments on state property and encourages local governments to do the same
> "Governor Newsom today issued an executive order directing state agencies to urgently address homeless encampments while respecting the dignity and safety of Californians experiencing homelessness."
- Source: [Governor's Office Press Release](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/07/25/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-address-homeless-encampments/)

**Local Action - Fremont Example:**
- Fremont adopted a citywide camping ordinance in February 2025
- Faced backlash from residents; had to revise language that would have penalized individuals for aiding homeless camps
- *[Need specific local news source for this]*

**Santa Monica / Statewide Count:**
- Approximately **50 cities** have adopted anti-camping ordinances
- Source: Berkeley Law student study (cited in third paragraph of Santa Monica article)

### B. CARE Court

**Original Promise vs. Reality:**

| What Newsom Promised | What Became Law |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 7,000-12,000 eligible | **528 enrolled** (as of July 2025) |
| Court-ordered treatment | **514 of 528 voluntary** (97%) |
| Counties fined for non-compliance | **Zero fines issued** |
| Real accountability | "Soft power" only |

- Source: [CalMatters - "How Gavin Newsom's CARE Court lost its teeth"](https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/12/care-court-california-changes/), December 17, 2025

**Updated Numbers (October 2025):**
- **3,092** CARE Court petitions received
- **684** treatment agreements approved
- Only **22** court-ordered CARE plans
- Source: [CalMatters - "New California law expands CARE Court"](https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/12/care-court-california-changes/), December 27, 2025, citing Judicial Council of California

**Key Quote - Family Perspective:**
> "I've wondered (about) the point of a court with no real power."
- Anita Fisher, San Diego mother who advocated for CARE Court but later called the program a "total failure"
- Source: CalMatters, "How CARE Court lost its teeth," page 4

**How the Bill Was Diluted (CalMatters Analysis):**

1. **Eligibility Narrowed:**
   - Original (March 2022): "mental illness and a substance use disorder"
   - Final law: Only "schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders"
   - 2025 Amendment (SB 27): Added bipolar I disorder with psychotic features

2. **Petitioner Burdens Increased:**
   - More documentation required
   - "Vexatious litigant" warnings added for repeat filers

3. **County Requirements Loosened:**
   - Original: "The plan **shall include** all of the following components"
   - Final: "The CARE plan **may include** only the following"
   - Housing not required to be provided

4. **Medication Orders Limited:**
   - Forcibly administered medication **banned**
   - No penalties for refusing ordered medication
   - Judges can only order medication with "clear and convincing evidence"

- Source: CalMatters legislative analysis, "How the bill was diluted" section, pages 7-12

## III. BOTTOM LINE

### A. Budget Tie-In

**Governor's Position:**
- Governor Newsom has told local officials they have "more resources than ever" and that it is "time to end the excuses"
- *[Need specific quote source/date]*

**HHAP Sunsetting:**
- The state is now **sunsetting major homelessness grant programs** including HHAP (Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention Program)
- This is a quiet acknowledgment that the Housing First approach failed to produce results
- Source: [California Budget documents / LAO analysis]

---

### B. Proposed Solutions

**Redirect Funding:**
- Cuts to programs incentivizing homelessness (HHAP and similar) should fund:
  - More law enforcement
  - Courts and drug-treatment programs
  - Pathways to mandatory drug treatment for those convicted and put into CARE Court or similar systems

**Fix CARE Court Problems:**
- Restore accountability mechanisms the Legislature stripped away
- Source for problems: [CalMatters CARE Court series](https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/12/care-court-california-changes/)

### C. What Real Compassion Looks Like

> "There is nothing compassionate about watching our most vulnerable neighbors live in squalor, cycle through emergency rooms, and die of overdoses on our sidewalks. Real compassion demands that we act, not just spend."

**Redirect Funding Toward What Works:**

1. **Drug Courts and Diversion Programs:**
   > "Drug court clients were **three times less likely to be arrested** one year after assignment to drug court than participants in standard courts."
   - Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 13
   - Original: Gottfredson & Exum, *Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency*, 2002

2. **Contingency Management:**
   > "In a review of the literature on CM from 2009 to 2014, researchers found that **86 percent of CM studies reported significant treatment effects**."
   - Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 9-10
   - Original: Davis et al., *Preventive Medicine*, 2016

   **VA Program Results:**
   > "Remarkably, **92 percent of drug tests** taken by participating veterans were negative and 56 percent of CM sessions were attended."
   - Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 10
   - Original: DePhilippis et al., *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2018

3. **Psychiatric Beds:**
   > "**83 percent of CA counties have zero chemical dependency beds**; 43 percent have no inpatient psychiatric care services at all."
   - Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 14

4. **Enforce Existing Laws:**
   - Not as punishment, but as leverage to connect people with care they need
   > "According to addiction experts like Keith Humphreys, an interaction with law enforcement or the criminal justice system is often the impetus for getting individuals the treatment they need because it makes clear the threat of serious punishment or jail time."
   - Source: Ludwig & Rauh, page 12
