## Key Arguments to Include (per Josh's Outline)

### Big Picture Points
- [ ] CA spending billions at state AND local level (calculate per-homeless-person cost)
- [ ] State failed to collect info on costs/outcomes (cite 3 audits)
- [ ] Current spending INCENTIVIZES homelessness (examples needed)
- [ ] It's NOT about housing - Figure 3 shows PSH grew but homelessness rose too
- [ ] "Housing First" was wrong; "Harm Reduction" was wrong
- [ ] ~75% of chronically homeless have mental illness and/or substance abuse

### What California Is Doing
- [ ] Anti-camping ordinances in major cities?
- [ ] CARE Court: Good theory, weak in practice (diluted by legislature)
- [ ] HHAP cancellation = recognition programs aren't working

### Bottom Line
- [ ] Cut failing programs (HHAP etc.)
- [ ] Redirect to: law enforcement, courts, drug treatment, mandatory treatment pathways
- [ ] Fix CARE Court problems
- [ ] Emphasize: THIS is actual compassion vs. "self-determined drugged out squalor"

## Tone Reference
- Based on existing OC Register op-ed by Josh & Jillian Ludwig
- Straightforward, data-driven, policy-focused
- Compassionate framing but critical of current approach

## Key Constraint
**NO PLAGIARISM** - Must synthesize and paraphrase sources, not copy verbatim. Can use placeholder figures where needed.
