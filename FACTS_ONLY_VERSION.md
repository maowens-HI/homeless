## Spending vs. Results

**California has spent $37 billion on homelessness since 2019 while the crisis has worsened.**

1. Homelessness increased 24% since Governor Newsom's 2019 "Marshall Plan" ([Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org/research/california-homelessness-rises-187000-perhaps-many-more-despite-37-billion-spent))
2. Current homeless population: ~187,000 people ([Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org/research/california-homelessness-rises-187000-perhaps-many-more-despite-37-billion-spent))
3. California's homeless population grew 31% from 2010-2020 while the national rate decreased 9% ([Ludwig & Rauh, Hoover](https://www.hoover.org/research/homelessness-california-causes-and-solutions))

## Accountability Gap

**Three separate audits found California cannot track where homelessness money goes or whether programs work.**

1. State Auditor (2024): Cal ICH "has not consistently tracked and evaluated the State's efforts" ([CA State Auditor](https://www.auditor.ca.gov))
2. Federal audit (2024): Department of Housing received lowest possible score for fraud detection; $319.5M at risk ([HUD OIG](https://www.hudoig.gov))
3. Legislative Analyst's Office: Legislature lacks "basic information on program outputs" ([LAO](https://lao.ca.gov))
