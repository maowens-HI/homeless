## Notes for Ben and Josh

- **Hook**: Opens with the "false compassion" framing as requested - spending ≠ caring
- **Placeholders**: Bracketed items [like this] need specific figures or graphics
- **HHAP**: Referenced the cancellation as signal of failure; may need more recent budget details
- **CARE Court**: Included legislative weakening narrative from CalMatters coverage
- **Tone**: Direct, data-driven, but compassionate framing
- **Length**: Currently at target range; can trim "Cutting Room Floor" content if needed to hit 600-800
- **Revision Note**: Rewrote to ensure all language is original; removed borrowed rhetorical devices

## Body of Op-Ed

Californians pride themselves on generosity. The state's spending on homelessness certainly reflects that self-image. Since 2019, California has directed [over $37 billion] toward homelessness programs—roughly [$245,000] for every homeless person counted that year. The state has constructed thousands of permanent supportive housing units and funded an alphabet soup of outreach teams, navigation centers, and grant programs.

The results? Homelessness has climbed relentlessly. California now counts approximately [187,000] people without stable housing—a [60 percent] increase since 2015 and a [24 percent] rise since Governor Newsom announced his ambitious plan to address the crisis. That number exceeds the entire population of many California cities, including Elk Grove, Salinas, and Santa Rosa.

The problem is not money. The problem is what we're doing with it.

**No One Is Watching the Dollars**

Three independent audits have delivered the same verdict: California has no idea whether its homelessness spending works. The state auditor concluded that the California Interagency Council on Homelessness "has not consistently tracked and evaluated the State's efforts." Federal auditors gave the state's housing department the lowest possible rating for fraud prevention. The Legislative Analyst's Office found that lawmakers lack "basic information on program outputs."

Billions spent. No meaningful accounting. No measurable improvement.

Generosity without oversight is not compassion—it is abandonment by another name.

**When Housing Alone Is Not the Answer**

Since 2016, state law has required a "Housing First" approach: provide permanent housing without demanding sobriety or treatment participation. The intent was to remove barriers. The outcome has been different.

California's permanent supportive housing inventory expanded by [150 percent] between 2010 and 2020. Homelessness expanded too. Studies indicate that after five years in Housing First programs, only [36 percent] of participants remain stably housed. Many rotate through placements before ending up back on the streets—or worse.

Here is what the data reveals: [approximately 75 percent] of California's chronically homeless population contends with severe mental illness, addiction, or both. Drug overdose has become the leading cause of death among homeless individuals in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Yet state-funded housing imposes no obligation to address these underlying conditions. We house people while their addictions and untreated illnesses continue to devastate them.

**CARE Court: Promise Versus Reality**

Governor Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022 as a corrective—a mechanism to compel treatment for those too incapacitated to seek it themselves, with real consequences for counties that failed to deliver services.

The Legislature had other ideas. Lawmakers narrowed who could qualify. They softened requirements on counties. They prohibited court-ordered medication. The result is a largely voluntary system that has enrolled just [528 people]—far short of the [7,000 to 12,000] the administration originally projected.

The recent elimination of the HHAP grant program—once central to the state's homelessness strategy—amounts to a quiet admission: the current model is failing.

**What Genuine Compassion Requires**

Watching vulnerable Californians deteriorate in encampments, shuttle through emergency rooms, and die from overdoses is not compassion. It is passive cruelty.

Genuine compassion requires intervention. California should shift resources toward approaches with demonstrated results: drug courts and diversion programs that route people into treatment rather than incarceration. Contingency management—using modest incentives to support sobriety—achieves significant results in [86 percent] of clinical studies. The state desperately needs psychiatric capacity; [83 percent] of California counties lack any chemical dependency beds.

CARE Court must be strengthened with the accountability provisions that were stripped during the legislative process. And existing laws against public camping and open drug use should be enforced—not punitively, but as a pathway to connect people with services they would otherwise refuse.

Compassion cannot mean unlimited funding with no expectations. It cannot mean looking away while people suffer and die in public view. Real compassion confronts crisis with action: treatment, structure, and a credible route to stability.

California has spent lavishly on this problem. The question is whether we are ready to actually solve it.

## Cutting Room Floor

**Alternative opening (more direct):**
> "The tent cities visible from California's freeways represent a $37 billion failure. That is what the state has spent on homelessness since 2019. The encampments keep growing."

**Additional CARE Court detail (if space permits):**
> Of the 528 people in CARE Court treatment plans, 514 enrolled voluntarily rather than by court order. The state has yet to penalize a single county for failing to provide required services.

**Prop 47 angle (cut for length but relevant):**
> Proposition 47, passed in 2014, reduced most drug crimes to misdemeanors and eliminated much of the leverage courts once used to direct people into treatment. Polling suggests a majority of Californians now favor revising the law.

**Housing cost angle (cut for length):**
> Building costs have reached absurd levels. Los Angeles regularly spends over $1 million per unit of homeless housing. A recent Santa Monica project came in at $1 million per door.
