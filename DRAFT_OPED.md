## Notes for Ben and Josh

- **Hook**: Opens with the "false compassion" framing as requested - spending ≠ caring
- **Placeholders**: Bracketed items [like this] need specific figures or graphics
- **HHAP**: Referenced the cancellation as signal of failure; may need more recent budget details
- **CARE Court**: Included legislative weakening narrative from CalMatters coverage
- **Tone**: Modeled after the OC Register piece - direct, data-driven, but compassionate framing
- **Length**: Currently at target range; can trim "Cutting Room Floor" content if needed to hit 600-800

## Body of Op-Ed

Californians like to believe we're a compassionate state. We certainly spend like one. Since 2019, California has poured [over $37 billion] into homelessness programs—a figure that works out to roughly [$245,000] for every homeless person counted that year. We've built thousands of permanent supportive housing units. We've funded outreach teams, navigation centers, and grant programs with names designed to inspire hope.

And yet, homelessness has surged. The state now counts approximately [187,000] people living on its streets and in its shelters—a [60 percent] increase since 2015 and a [24 percent] jump since Governor Newsom declared his "Marshall Plan" to end the crisis. If California's homeless population were a city, it would rank among the [140 largest] in America, bigger than cities like Salem, Oregon or Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Something is deeply wrong. And it isn't a lack of funding.

**The Accountability Void**

Three separate audits—from the state auditor, the federal government, and the Legislative Analyst's Office—have reached the same damning conclusion: California cannot account for where its homelessness dollars go or whether they work. The state auditor found that the California Interagency Council on Homelessness "has not consistently tracked and evaluated the State's efforts." A federal audit gave the state's housing department its lowest possible score for fraud detection. The LAO reported that legislators lack even "basic information on program outputs."

We are spending billions with no receipts and no results.

This is not compassion. It is negligence dressed up as generosity.

**The Housing First Fallacy**

Since 2016, California law has mandated a "Housing First" approach—providing permanent housing without requiring sobriety or participation in treatment. The theory sounds humane: meet people where they are. In practice, it has been a catastrophe.

Permanent supportive housing units in California grew by [150 percent] between 2010 and 2020. Homelessness grew right alongside it. Research shows that after five years in Housing First programs, only [36 percent] of participants remain housed—and many cycle through multiple placements before returning to the streets or dying.

The problem is that homelessness in California is not primarily a housing problem. Studies consistently find that [approximately 75 percent] of the chronically homeless population struggles with severe mental illness, substance abuse, or both. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death among homeless individuals in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Yet under Housing First and its companion philosophy of "harm reduction," those receiving state-funded housing face no requirement to seek treatment for the conditions killing them.

**A Court Without Teeth**

Governor Newsom recognized this failure when he proposed CARE Court in 2022, promising "accountability" for both counties and individuals. The original vision was compelling: courts would compel treatment for those too ill to help themselves, and counties would face consequences for failing to provide services.

But as CalMatters has documented, the Legislature systematically gutted the proposal. Eligibility was narrowed. Requirements on counties were loosened. Forced medication was banned outright. What emerged was a voluntary program that has enrolled just [528 people]—a fraction of the [7,000 to 12,000] Newsom initially projected.

California's recent cancellation of the HHAP grant program—once a centerpiece of homelessness funding—signals what officials won't say publicly: the current approach has failed.

**What Real Compassion Looks Like**

There is nothing compassionate about watching our most vulnerable neighbors live in squalor, cycle through emergency rooms, and die of overdoses on our sidewalks. Real compassion demands that we act—not just spend.

California should redirect funding from failed programs toward what actually works: expanded drug courts and diversion programs that channel people into treatment rather than jail. Contingency management, which uses small incentives to encourage sobriety, has shown [86 percent] effectiveness in clinical studies. We need more psychiatric beds—[83 percent] of California counties currently have none—and residential treatment facilities where people can recover.

We must fix CARE Court, restoring the accountability mechanisms the Legislature stripped away. And we must enforce existing laws against public camping and drug use, not as punishment, but as leverage to connect people with the care they need.

Compassion is not a blank check. It is not averting our eyes while people destroy themselves in tent encampments. True compassion meets suffering with action—treatment, accountability, and a genuine path to recovery.

California has tried spending its way out of this crisis. It's time to try caring our way out instead.

## Cutting Room Floor

**Alternative opening (more aggressive):**
> "Walk through any major California city and you'll see what $37 billion buys: tent encampments stretching for blocks, open-air drug markets, and human beings living in conditions we wouldn't tolerate for animals. This is what passes for compassion in the Golden State."

**Additional CARE Court detail (if space permits):**
> The numbers tell the story of a program designed to fail. Of the 528 people enrolled in CARE Court treatment plans, 514 entered through voluntary agreements rather than court orders. The state has not issued a single fine to counties that failed to provide mandated services.

**Prop 47 angle (cut for length but relevant):**
> California's 2014 Proposition 47 made matters worse by downgrading most drug offenses to misdemeanors, eliminating the leverage courts once had to mandate treatment. A Berkeley poll found 59 percent of voters now support amending the law.

**Housing cost angle (cut for length):**
> The cost of building housing for the homeless has become almost farcical. Los Angeles routinely spends over $1 million per unit. Santa Monica recently approved a 122-unit complex at $1 million per door—three blocks from the beach.
