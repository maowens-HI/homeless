## Notes for Ben and Josh

**Outline Coverage:**
- **Big Picture (Spending):** Included $37B state figure, local spending (LA $953M, SF $786M, SD $105M), per-person calculation (~$197K)
- **Three Audits:** All three referenced (State Auditor, Federal/HUD Inspector General, LAO)
- **Perverse Incentives:** Framed Housing First as incentivizing continued drug use
- **Housing First Failure:** Included 37% homelessness increase since 2016, PSH growth paradox
- **Mental Health/Drugs:** 75% statistic included, drug overdose as leading cause of death
- **Anti-Camping Ordinances:** Referenced Grants Pass ruling and 50+ cities adopting ordinances
- **CARE Court:** Covered dilution issues, low enrollment (556 petitions, 39% dismissed), services not delivered
- **HHAP Cancellation:** Tied to budget as admission of failure
- **Bottom Line:** Redirect funding to enforcement, courts, drug treatment; real compassion framing

**Figure:** Recommend including updated housing inventory vs. homeless population chart (2016-2024) if space permits in final publication

**Tone:** Matches OC Register piece—measured, data-driven, reframes enforcement as compassion

## Body of Op-Ed

California has spent $37 billion on homelessness since 2019. Los Angeles alone budgets nearly $1 billion annually. San Francisco commits $786 million. Yet the state now counts 187,000 people without stable housing—the largest unsheltered homeless population in America, with 48 per 10,000 residents experiencing homelessness compared to a national average of 23.

That $37 billion works out to roughly $197,000 for every homeless person in California. Where did the money go? No one can say.

Three independent audits have reached the same damning conclusion: California does not track whether its homelessness spending works. The state auditor found that the California Interagency Council on Homelessness "has not consistently tracked and evaluated the State's efforts." Federal auditors gave the state's housing department the lowest possible rating for fraud prevention, putting $319.5 million in federal funds at risk. The Legislative Analyst's Office reported that lawmakers lack "basic information on program outputs"—including how many people living in encampments have received permanent housing.

Billions spent. No accountability. No improvement.

The state's mandatory "Housing First" policy, in place since 2016, provides permanent supportive housing without requiring sobriety or treatment participation. The theory was that stable housing would enable recovery. The results tell a different story. Since Housing First became law, homelessness has increased 37 percent—even as the state added thousands of new supportive housing units. A San Francisco Chronicle study found that a quarter of permanent supportive housing participants tracked by the city exited the program by dying, and more than a fifth returned to homelessness.

Housing alone cannot solve a crisis driven primarily by mental illness and addiction. Approximately 75 percent of California's chronically homeless population struggles with substance abuse, severe mental illness, or both. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death among homeless individuals in both Los Angeles and San Francisco. Yet Housing First implicitly incentivizes continued drug use by imposing no treatment obligations. This is not compassion—it is abandonment dressed up as policy.

California's recent reforms acknowledge the problem without solving it. Following the Supreme Court's Grants Pass decision, which upheld cities' authority to enforce anti-camping ordinances, Governor Newsom issued an executive order directing state agencies to clear encampments. More than 50 California cities have since adopted camping restrictions. But clearing camps without adequate treatment options simply relocates the problem.

CARE Court, Newsom's signature mental health initiative, was designed to compel treatment for those too incapacitated to seek it themselves. In practice, the Legislature stripped it of meaningful enforcement. Of 556 CARE petitions filed through June 2024, 39 percent were dismissed. Among participants who remained, over half did not receive at least one ordered mental health service. Counties cannot even explain why—for 31 percent of undelivered services, agencies "did not know or specify the reason."

The state's recent decision to sunset the HHAP grant program—once central to its homelessness strategy—is a quiet admission that current approaches have failed.

California needs a different model. Resources currently funding programs that incentivize homelessness should be redirected toward law enforcement, courts, and treatment facilities. Drug courts reduce rearrest rates threefold. Contingency management—using incentives to reinforce sobriety—proves effective in 86 percent of clinical studies. Yet 83 percent of California counties have zero chemical dependency beds.

CARE Court must be restored to its original design: real accountability for counties, real consequences for non-compliance, and genuine pathways to mandatory treatment for those convicted of crimes or found incapable of caring for themselves.

There is nothing compassionate about watching our most vulnerable neighbors deteriorate in encampments, cycle through emergency rooms, and die of overdoses on our sidewalks. Real compassion requires action—not just spending. It demands that we treat the illness, not merely tolerate its symptoms.

California has proven it will spend generously on this crisis. The question is whether it will finally spend wisely.

## Cutting Room Floor

**Alternative Title Options:**
- "California's $37 Billion Failure"
- "Compassion Requires More Than a Check"
- "The Housing First Fallacy"

**Stronger Opening (more confrontational, cut for tone):**
> The tent encampments lining California's freeways are monuments to failure—$37 billion worth. That is what the state has spent on homelessness since 2019. The camps keep growing.

**Additional CARE Court Detail (cut for length):**
> Initial state estimates projected 7,000 to 12,000 Californians would meet CARE Court criteria. Fewer than 600 petitions have been filed. One San Diego mother who advocated for the program now calls it a "total failure," asking: "What is the point of a court with no real power?"

**Local Spending Breakdown (cut for flow but useful context):**
> Major cities are spending at staggering rates: Los Angeles commits $953 million annually to homelessness services, San Francisco $786 million, and even San Diego allocates $105 million—yet visible homelessness continues to grow in each city.

**Prop 47 Angle (relevant but cut for length):**
> Proposition 47, passed in 2014, reduced most drug crimes to misdemeanors, eliminating much of the leverage courts once used to direct people into treatment. A majority of Californians now favor revising the law—a sign that voters recognize enforcement has a role to play.

**Psychiatric Bed Crisis (could be added if length permits):**
> California faces a severe shortage of treatment capacity: 83 percent of counties have zero chemical dependency beds, and 43 percent lack any inpatient psychiatric care whatsoever. You cannot mandate treatment when treatment does not exist.

**Harm Reduction Critique (cut but aligns with Josh's points):**
> The "harm reduction" philosophy—distributing clean needles and safe injection supplies without demanding behavioral change—has not reduced harm. It has enabled addiction to continue under state supervision. Compassion without expectation is indistinguishable from neglect.
